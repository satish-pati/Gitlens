Pull Request Analysis: Make gifs collapsible by default
Overview
The pull request, authored by tbcrawford, aims to make GIFs collapsible by default. The changes are made in the src/main.js file, with a total of 8 changes.

Functionality Changes
The changes introduce a new functionality where GIFs are wrapped in a details element, making them collapsible by default. The summary element is used to display the search query, and the GIF is displayed inside the details element.


const searchQuery = select('.ghg-giphy-results').attributes['data-search-query'].value
insertText(textArea, 
  `
${searchQuery}
\n` + 
  `  \n` + 
  `  \n` + 
  `
`)

This change improves the user experience by allowing users to collapse GIFs, reducing clutter in the text area.

Structure Changes
The changes modify the existing insertText function to include the new details and summary elements. The code is well-structured, and the changes are easy to follow.

However, it would be beneficial to consider extracting the HTML template into a separate variable or function to improve readability and maintainability.

Performance Changes
The changes do not appear to have a significant impact on performance. The introduction of the details and summary elements may add a minimal amount of overhead, but it should not be noticeable.

Improvements
The changes improve the user experience by making GIFs collapsible by default.
The code is well-structured and easy to follow.
Potential Issues
The changes may not work as expected in older browsers that do not support the details and summary elements.
The use of insertText may lead to potential security vulnerabilities if the input is not properly sanitized.
Security Concerns
The changes do not appear to introduce any significant security concerns. However, it is essential to ensure that the input is properly sanitized to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

Best Practices and Optimizations
Consider extracting the HTML template into a separate variable or function to improve readability and maintainability.
Use a templating engine or a library like DOMPurify to sanitize the input and prevent potential security vulnerabilities.
Test the changes in different browsers and environments to ensure compatibility and functionality.
Conclusion
The pull request makes a positive change to the functionality of the application, making GIFs collapsible by default. However, it is essential to consider potential issues, security concerns, and best practices to ensure the changes are robust and maintainable.
