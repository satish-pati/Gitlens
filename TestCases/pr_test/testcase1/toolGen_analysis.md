PR Description:
Pull Request Analysis: Fixed UI breaking on narrow screens
Overview
The pull request, authored by Jonghakseo, aims to fix a UI issue that occurs on narrow screens. The changes are implemented in two files: src/main.js and src/style.css.

Changes Analysis
src/main.js
The following changes were made to src/main.js:

toolbarGroup.prepend(clonedNode) was added, replacing the original toolbarGroup.append(clonedNode).
This change affects the functionality of the code by altering the order in which elements are added to the toolbar group. The new code prepends the cloned node to the toolbar group, whereas the original code appended it.

src/style.css
The following changes were made to src/style.css:

A new CSS rule was added: .ghg-trigger { display: inline-block; width: fit-content; }
This change improves the structure and performance of the code by adding a specific style rule for the .ghg-trigger class. The display: inline-block property ensures that the element is displayed as an inline block, while width: fit-content sets the width of the element to fit its content.

Impact on Functionality, Structure, and Performance
The changes made in this pull request have the following impact:

Functionality: The changes fix the UI issue on narrow screens, ensuring that the layout is correct and functional.
Structure: The addition of a specific CSS rule for the .ghg-trigger class improves the structure of the code by making it more modular and maintainable.
Performance: The changes do not have a significant impact on performance, as they only affect the layout and styling of the UI.
Improvements, Potential Issues, and Security Concerns
The following improvements, potential issues, and security concerns were identified:

Improvement: The addition of a specific CSS rule for the .ghg-trigger class improves the maintainability and readability of the code.
Potential Issue: The change from append to prepend in src/main.js may affect the functionality of other parts of the code that rely on the original ordering of elements.
Security Concern: None were identified in this pull request.
Best Practices and Optimizations
The following best practices and optimizations are suggested:

Use meaningful variable names: The variable name clonedNode is not very descriptive. Consider using a more descriptive name to improve code readability.
Consider using a more robust layout system: The use of display: inline-block and width: fit-content may not be sufficient for all scenarios. Consider using a more robust layout system, such as CSS Grid or Flexbox, to improve the layout and responsiveness of the UI.
Test thoroughly: Thoroughly test the changes to ensure that they do not introduce any new issues or affect the functionality of other parts of the code.
Conclusion
The pull request fixes a UI issue on narrow screens and improves the structure and maintainability of the code. However, it is essential to thoroughly test the changes and consider potential issues that may arise from the change in element ordering. By following best practices and optimizing the code, the overall quality and reliability of the codebase can be improved.
