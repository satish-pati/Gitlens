The given Python script contains a test suite for the factorial function. The function calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. The test cases include:

test_factorial_positive: Validates the factorial calculation for positive integers like 5 and 3.

test_factorial_zero: Verifies that the factorial of 0 is 1.

test_factorial_one: Verifies that the factorial of 1 is 1.

test_factorial_large: Tests the factorial of a larger number (10) to ensure the function handles large values correctly.
